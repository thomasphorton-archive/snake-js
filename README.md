## Snake

A simple snake game that I wrote a few years ago. I'm going to give it an overhaul using some of the techniques I've learned since I last cracked open the code.

The initial commit is almost 100% as it was when it was hosted on [my old portfolio site](https://lit-dawn-2592.herokuapp.com/404). It was dependent on some shared styles that are no longer there, but we'll fix that later.

Follow along as I try and polish this old rust bucket. You can read more on [my blog](http://thomasphorton.com). Feel free to jump in with feature requests, suggestions, or PRs.

## Testing
Tests are currently ran in-browser with Mocha, using Chai's expect assertion library.

## Todo
* Continue refactoring code into modules
* Gulp workflow
* Travis CI integration
* Have fun
